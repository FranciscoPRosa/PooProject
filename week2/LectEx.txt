In-lecture exercise 1

The Point class
The goal of this in-lecture exercise is to get familiar with the following:
    explicit constructor invocation, and
    method overriding from Object class, particularly toString, equals, hashCode methods.
1. Provide a class named Point with two integer fields, x and y, with:
    A no-arg constructor, where both x and y should be initialised with 0.
    A constructor with one parameter, where x is initialized with the value passed by the argument and y is initialized with 0.
    A constructor with two parameters, where x and y are initialized with the values passed by the arguments.

Use explicit constructor invocations whenever possible. 
 
2. In the main method, create three objects: (0,0), (0,0) and (2,3). Print their textual description, and test for identity and equality. 
 
3. Override toString to provide a textual description of a Point as "(x,y)". Run the program and check for their new textual descriptions. 
 
4. Override equals to provide equality when the x's and the y's of the points being compared are the same. When equals is overridden, which other method should also be overridden? Override it. 
 
5. In the main method, create a HashSet<Point> and insert the three points in it. What happens? What happens if one or both of the previous methods are not overridden?
